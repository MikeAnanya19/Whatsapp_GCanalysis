# WhatsApp Chat Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of WhatsApp chat logs. The analysis includes message counts, media statistics, emoji usage, word count, and link sharing among participants.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Python Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install emoji
pip install wordcloud
pip install regex pandas numpy plotly matplotlib Pillow
```

## File Structure

- `WA_Chat.txt`: The WhatsApp chat log file to be analyzed.
- `analyze_chat.py`: The Python script containing the analysis code.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and setup.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Chat File**:
   - Export your WhatsApp chat in `.txt` format and save it as `WA_Chat.txt` in the project directory.

2. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Execute the Python script to perform the chat analysis:
   ```bash
   python analyze_chat.py
   ```
   
3. **Script Functions**:

   - **Date and Time Detection**:
     The script identifies lines that start with a date and time format to segment the chat messages correctly.

   - **Data Parsing**:
     The chat log is parsed into a pandas DataFrame with columns for date, time, author, and message content.

   - **Message Analysis**:
     - **Total Messages**: Counts the total number of messages.
     - **Media Messages**: Counts the number of media messages.
     - **Emoji Analysis**: Extracts and counts emojis used in the chat.
     - **Link Analysis**: Identifies and counts URLs shared in the chat.
     - **User Statistics**: Provides detailed statistics for each participant, including messages sent, words per message, media messages sent, emojis used, and links shared.

   - **Emoji Frequency**:
     Lists the frequency of each emoji used in the chat.

## Visualization

You can also generate word clouds and other visualizations using the `wordcloud` and `plotly` libraries.

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud

wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400).generate(text)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```
